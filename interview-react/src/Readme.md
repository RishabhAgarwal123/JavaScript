1. Hooks:
    1. useState is a React hook that provides state management within a functional component. It allows you to store and update state, similar to how this.state works in class components. useState returns an array containing the current state value and a function to update it.
    Details:
    When the state is updated, the component re-renders to reflect the changes.
    You can initialize the state with a specific value, such as a number, string, or object.
    The state update function can take a new value directly or a function that receives the current state and returns a new value.
    
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default Counter;

    2. useEffect is a React hook used to perform side effects in functional components. This includes operations like data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulations, and more. You can control when the effect runs by specifying a dependency array.
    Details:
    Without a dependency array, the effect runs every time the component re-renders.
    With an empty dependency array ([]), the effect runs only once when the component is mounted (like componentDidMount).
    With a dependency array containing specific values, the effect runs only when those values change.
    Cleanup functions can be provided to run when the component is unmounted or before the effect re-runs (like componentWillUnmount).

    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    function Timer() {
    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
        setSeconds((prev) => prev + 1);
        }, 1000);

        return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup on unmount
    }, []); // Run once on mount

    return <p>Seconds: {seconds}</p>;
    }

    export default Timer;

    3. useContext is a React hook used to access values from a React context. Contexts allow you to share values among components without explicitly passing props down the component tree.
    Details:
    useContext requires a context object created with React.createContext.
    Contexts are useful for global state management within an application or feature.
    If the context value changes, components using useContext re-render to reflect the new value.
    
    import React, { useContext } from 'react';

    const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

    function ThemedComponent() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // Accessing context

    return (
        <div style={{ background: theme === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#FFF' }}>
        Current Theme: {theme}
        </div>
    );
    }

    function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark"> {/* Providing context */}
        <ThemedComponent />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
    }

    export default App;

    4. useReducer is a React hook used to manage more complex state logic, similar to Redux. It takes a reducer function and an initial state, returning the current state and a dispatch function to update it based on actions.
    Details:
    A reducer function takes the current state and an action, returning the new state.
    useReducer is ideal for managing complex state with multiple transitions.
    It provides an alternative to useState when you need to encapsulate state transitions in a single location.

    import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

    const initialState = { count: 0 };
    const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
        return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
        throw new Error('Unknown action');
    }
    };

    function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    return (
        <div>
        <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default Counter;

    5. useMemo is a React hook that memoizes the result of a computation, preventing unnecessary recalculations when dependencies remain unchanged. This can help optimize performance in certain scenarios.
    Details:
    useMemo takes a function and a dependency array.
    The function is re-executed only when the dependencies change.
    It's useful for expensive computations, ensuring they're not re-run without need.

    import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

    function Factorial({ num }) {
    const factorial = useMemo(() => {
        const computeFactorial = (n) => (n <= 1 ? 1 : n * computeFactorial(n - 1));
        return computeFactorial(num);
    }, [num]); // Recalculate only if `num` changes

    return <p>Factorial of {num} is {factorial}</p>;
    }

    export default Factorial;

    6. useCallback is a React hook that memoizes a callback function, preventing it from being re-created unnecessarily when dependencies remain unchanged. It's useful for avoiding performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders caused by changing callback references.
    Details:
    useCallback takes a callback function and a dependency array.
    The callback function is re-created only when the dependencies change.
    Commonly used when passing callbacks to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

    import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = useCallback(() => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    }, [count]); // Re-create callback only when `count` changes

    return (
        <div>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default Counter;

    7. useRef is a React hook that creates a mutable reference to a DOM element or a value. It doesn't trigger re-renders when the referenced value changes. useRef is often used to directly access DOM elements or to persist a mutable value across re-renders.
    Details:
    useRef returns an object with a current property.
    The current property can hold a DOM element reference or any value.
    It doesn't cause re-renders when the current value changes.

    import React, { useRef } from 'react';

    function InputFocus() {
        // useRef is used to persist a mutable value that doesn't trigger a re-render when it changes. It's also commonly used to get 
        // a reference to a DOM element.
        const inputRef = useRef(null);

        const focusInput = () => {
            if (inputRef.current) {
                inputRef.current.focus(); // Access the DOM element directly
            }
        };

        return (
            <div>
                <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
                <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus the Input</button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default InputFocus;

2. Higher Order Components:
    Higher Order Components (HOCs) are an advanced concept in React that allows you to reuse component logic and structure in a more flexible way. Let's dive into the details about why they're useful, when to use them, how to create them, and what they are.

    What is a Higher Order Component?
    A Higher Order Component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with enhanced capabilities. This allows you to encapsulate common logic in a reusable way, promoting code reusability and composition.

    Why Use Higher Order Components?
    The primary reasons to use HOCs are:
    Code Reuse: HOCs help you avoid duplicating logic across different components.
    Cross-Cutting Concerns: They allow you to encapsulate concerns like authentication, authorization, or data fetching in a single place.
    Separation of Concerns: HOCs enable you to separate logic from presentation, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.

    When to Use Higher Order Components?
    HOCs are ideal for:
    Reusing Component Logic: If you have logic that is used across multiple components, HOCs can help encapsulate and reuse that logic.
    Encapsulation of Cross-Cutting Concerns: HOCs can be used to encapsulate logic related to concerns that affect multiple components, such as handling permissions or loading states.
    Dynamic Composition: HOCs can dynamically enhance components at runtime, allowing for more flexible compositions.
    How to Create a Higher Order Component?
    Creating a HOC involves writing a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with additional functionality. Here's a simple example of an HOC that adds a loading spinner while fetching data:

    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    // Higher Order Component that handles data fetching and loading spinner
    function withLoadingSpinner(WrappedComponent, fetchData) {
    return function () {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

        useEffect(() => {
        fetchData().then((result) => {
            setData(result);
            setLoading(false);
        });
        }, []);

        if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
        }

        return <WrappedComponent data={data} />;
    };
    }

    // Component to be enhanced by HOC
    function DataDisplay({ data }) {
    return (
        <div>
        <h2>Fetched Data:</h2>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
    );
    }

    // Fetch function to be used with HOC
    const fetchData = () => {
    return fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1').then((response) => response.json());
    };

    // Create a new component using HOC
    const DataDisplayWithLoading = withLoadingSpinner(DataDisplay, fetchData);

    export default DataDisplayWithLoading;

3. Component Life Cycle:
    Mounting:

    This is the stage when a component is created and inserted into the DOM. It involves the following lifecycle methods:
    constructor(props): The initial setup for a component, where you can initialize state and bind methods. It's called before the component is mounted.
    getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Invoked right before rendering, used to derive state from props. It is static, so it does not have access to this.
    render(): The method responsible for rendering the component to the DOM. It must be pure and return JSX.
    componentDidMount(): Called after the component has been rendered to the DOM. It's commonly used for data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or starting animations.
    
    Updating:

    This stage occurs when a component's state or props change, leading to a re-rendering of the component. Several lifecycle methods are involved in updating:
    getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): As mentioned above, this method can also be triggered during updates to re-derive state from props.
    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): This method determines whether a re-render is necessary. Returning false can prevent unnecessary re-rendering.
    render(): The component is re-rendered to reflect the changes in state or props.
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): This method is called before the DOM is updated, allowing you to capture the current state of the DOM (like scroll position). The return value can be used in componentDidUpdate.
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot): Invoked after the component is updated in the DOM. It's often used for interacting with the DOM or performing side effects based on the update.
    
    Unmounting:

    This stage occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. There's only one lifecycle method:
    componentWillUnmount(): Called just before the component is unmounted from the DOM. This is typically used to clean up resources like event listeners, subscriptions, or timers to prevent memory leaks.

4. State management is a crucial aspect of modern front-end development, particularly in frameworks like React. It determines how   data flows through an application and how components communicate with each other. The primary concepts involved in state management are State/Props, Props Drilling, and Context. Here's what they are, how they work, and when to use them:
    
    State/Props:
    State: Represents the internal data of a component. It's mutable, meaning it can change over time due to user interactions or other events. State is managed within a component, and changes to state typically trigger a re-render.
    Props: Short for properties, props are read-only inputs to a component. They are passed down from parent components and cannot be changed by the receiving component. Props are used to provide data and behavior to a component.
    
    How to Use State/Props:
    State: Use state for data that changes within a component. Initialize state in the constructor or with React's useState hook in functional components. Update state with setState or useState's updater function.
    Props: Use props to pass data and functions from a parent component to a child component. Define props in the parent and consume them in the child.
    
    When to Use State/Props:
    State: Ideal for component-specific data like form inputs, local component toggles, or data fetched from an API that is displayed in a specific component.
    Props: Best for passing data down the component tree. Use props when you want to share data or behavior between a parent and its children.

    Props Drilling
    Props drilling refers to the process of passing props through multiple levels of the component tree. This happens when a deeply nested child needs data or functions from a parent, requiring all intermediate components to pass them down.

    How to Use Props Drilling:
    Pass props from a parent component down to its children. This may require passing through multiple intermediate components that don't necessarily need the props themselves.
    
    When to Use Props Drilling:
    It's suitable for simpler component hierarchies or when there's not a lot of nesting. Props drilling can become problematic when there's a deep component tree, making it harder to maintain and manage changes.

    Context
    React's Context API allows you to share data across the component tree without passing props through every level. It creates a context with a default value and provides a mechanism for components to access and update this shared data.

    How to Use Context:
    Create a context with React.createContext() and define a Provider to supply the context's value to its children.
    Use a Consumer or useContext hook to access the context's value in child components.
    Context is often used with a global state or settings that need to be accessed across multiple components.
    
    When to Use Context:
    Use context when you have data that needs to be shared across a wide range of components, reducing the need for props drilling.
    It is ideal for theming, user authentication, or other global states where components across the application require access to the same data or settings.

5. Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow you to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components. They help you create cleaner, more maintainable code by abstracting common behaviors into reusable functions. Let's explore when, why, and how to use custom hooks, along with some example code.

    When to Use Custom Hooks
    Custom hooks are useful in several scenarios:
    Reusing State Logic: When multiple components share similar logic or behavior, a custom hook allows you to centralize that logic, reducing code duplication.
    Complex Component Logic: If a component has complex state management or multiple useEffect calls, extracting parts of that logic into custom hooks can improve readability.
    Separation of Concerns: Custom hooks allow you to separate state logic from rendering logic, leading to more modular code.
    Abstracting External APIs: If you're integrating with external services (e.g., fetching data from an API), a custom hook can encapsulate that logic for consistent use across components.

    Why Use Custom Hooks
    The benefits of custom hooks include:
    Reusability: Custom hooks promote code reuse, allowing you to apply the same logic to multiple components without redundancy.
    Readability and Maintainability: Custom hooks help break down complex components into smaller, more manageable pieces, making code easier to understand and maintain.
    Testing: By extracting logic into custom hooks, you can write unit tests for specific behaviors, improving code quality.
    Encapsulation: Custom hooks encapsulate internal state and side effects, providing a clean interface for components to interact with.

    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    // Custom hook to fetch data from a given URL
    const useFetchData = (url) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(url);
            if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Error fetching data: ${response.statusText}`);
            }
            const result = await response.json();
            setData(result);
        } catch (err) {
            setError(err);
        } finally {
            setLoading(false);
        }
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [url]); // Dependency on URL

    return { data, loading, error };
    };

    export default useFetchData;

    // Using custom hook
    import React from 'react';
    import useFetchData from './useFetchData';

    const DataDisplay = ({ url }) => {
    const { data, loading, error } = useFetchData(url);

    if (loading) {
        return <p>Loading...</p>;
    }

    if (error) {
        return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
    }

    return (
        <div>
        <h2>Data from {url}</h2>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
    );
    };

    export default DataDisplay;

6. Lazy loading is a powerful technique used in front-end development to improve performance and reduce the initial load time of a web application. By loading resources (like JavaScript files, images, or other assets) only when needed, lazy loading can help reduce the amount of data sent to the client and improve user experience.

In the context of React, lazy loading is often achieved through code splitting, chunking, and the use of React's Suspense component. Let's delve into these concepts and see how they work together to enable lazy loading.

    Code Splitting:
    Code splitting is the practice of breaking up an application into smaller bundles (or chunks) that can be loaded separately. This reduces the initial download size, allowing the browser to load only the necessary code for the current view or user action.

    React applications commonly use Webpack to achieve code splitting. Here's an example of code splitting with React's React.lazy and React.Suspense:
    # Webpack and React setup (simplified)
    npm install --save react react-dom
    npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
    // LazyLoadingExample.js
    import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

    // Lazily import a component
    const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));

    // A simple component using Suspense
    const LazyLoadingExample = () => {
    return (
        <div>
        <h2>Lazy Loading with Suspense</h2>
        {/* Suspense displays fallback content while the component loads */}
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <LazyComponent /> {/* This component is loaded lazily */}
        </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
    };

    export default LazyLoadingExample;

    Chunking:
    Chunking refers to the process of breaking a large bundle into smaller, more manageable chunks. This happens during the code-splitting process, where Webpack creates separate files for different parts of the application.

    Webpack uses a combination of dynamic imports and a chunking strategy to generate these separate bundles. Here's a basic Webpack configuration that supports code splitting and chunking:
    // webpack.config.js
    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'main.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        publicPath: '/', // Needed for lazy loading to work properly
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
        {
            test: /\.jsx?$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
                presets: ['@babel/preset-react', '@babel/preset-env'],
            },
            },
        },
        ],
    },
    optimization: {
        splitChunks: {
        chunks: 'all', // Splits code into chunks based on import patterns
        },
    },
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist',
        historyApiFallback: true, // Necessary for React Router
    },
    };

    React Suspense:
    React.Suspense is a component that allows you to define fallback content while lazy-loaded components are being fetched. It works in conjunction with React.lazy to enable lazy loading of components. Suspense is especially useful when you have a complex application with multiple lazy-loaded components.

    In the example code snippet above, Suspense is used to wrap the LazyComponent. While the component is loading, the fallback content ("Loading...") is displayed to provide a seamless user experience.

7. Routing is a key aspect of modern web applications, allowing developers to define navigation paths and control access to different parts of the application. When implementing role-based access control (RBAC), you need to consider user roles, permissions, and protected routes. Let's discuss these concepts along with other common routing features in React applications, focusing on react-router.

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    RBAC is a system for controlling user access to various parts of an application based on their roles or permissions. In a routing context, this means restricting certain routes to users with specific roles.

    Handling Routes with react-router
    React Router is a popular library for managing routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes, create nested routes, manage query parameters, and implement dynamic routing. Here's a basic setup with React Router:

    # Install React Router
    npm install react-router-dom
    import React from 'react';
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

    // Sample components for routes
    const Home = () => <h2>Home</h2>;
    const About = () => <h2>About</h2>;
    const Contact = () => <h2>Contact</h2>;

    const AppRouter = () => (
    <Router>
        <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
        </nav>
        <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        </Switch>
    </Router>
    );

    export default AppRouter;

    Protected Routes:
    A protected route restricts access to users with specific roles or permissions. Implementing protected routes typically involves checking user authentication and role-based access before rendering a component. Here's an example of a basic protected route:

    Query Parameters:
    Query parameters are key-value pairs appended to a URL to pass additional information to a route. They are often used for filtering, searching, or pagination. React Router provides access to query parameters through the useLocation hook. Here's an example:

    Dynamic Routing:
    Dynamic routing allows you to create routes with variable segments. These segments are often used for parameters like user IDs or product IDs. React Router provides this functionality through the use of colons in route paths. Here's an example:

8. Reusability
    Reusability is the practice of designing components, functions, or modules so that they can be used in different parts of an application or in different applications altogether. This principle helps reduce redundancy, improves code maintenance, and accelerates development.

    Why Reusability Matters:
    Efficiency: Reusable components reduce the time and effort needed to implement new features.
    Consistency: Reusing the same component or function in multiple places ensures a consistent behavior and user experience.
    Reduced Maintenance: When you fix a bug or add a feature in a reusable component, you don't have to repeat the change in multiple places.

    How to Achieve Reusability:
    Design Modular Components: Create components with clear, focused purposes. Avoid tightly coupling components to specific implementations.

    Use Custom Hooks: In React, custom hooks encapsulate logic for reuse across different components.
    Abstract Common Logic: Identify common patterns and move them into reusable functions or utility modules.
    Separate Concerns: Keep data manipulation, business logic, and presentation logic separate.

9. Modularity
    Modularity is the principle of breaking down a software system into smaller, self-contained units or modules. Each module should have a single responsibility and be easily replaceable without affecting the rest of the system.

    Why Modularity Matters:
    Scalability: Modularity makes it easier to add new features or extend functionality.
    Maintainability: Smaller, modular units are easier to understand, maintain, and refactor.
    Collaboration: Teams can work on different modules independently, promoting parallel development.

    How to Achieve Modularity:
    Use Components: In React, components are a natural way to achieve modularity. Design components with a single responsibility and well-defined interfaces.
    Encapsulate State: Avoid sharing state across multiple components. Use context or state management libraries for global state.
    Implement Dependency Injection: This allows you to replace modules without affecting the overall system.
    Adopt a Layered Architecture: Separate your application into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to promote modularity.

10. Testability
    Testability refers to the ease with which you can test a piece of software. A testable system allows for reliable automated testing, ensuring that your code works as expected and reducing the risk of bugs.

    Why Testability Matters:
    Reliability: Testable code helps catch bugs early and ensures that new changes don't break existing functionality.
    Confidence: Automated tests give developers confidence in their code, allowing them to make changes without fear of introducing bugs.
    Faster Development: Testable code supports rapid iteration and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
    How to Achieve Testability:
    Write Testable Components: Design components with clear inputs and outputs. Avoid side effects and global state within components.
    Use Dependency Injection: This allows you to mock dependencies in tests, making it easier to isolate components during testing.
    Adopt a Testing Framework: In React, tools like Jest and React Testing Library are popular for writing unit and integration tests.
    Implement TDD (Test-Driven Development): Writing tests before implementing functionality ensures that code is testable from the start.
